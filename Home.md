## Project Overview
EECS 183. Fall 2017.

**Overview.** Create a working game of Connect 4! This two-player game involves two players alternately dropping colored tokens into a column of a 6x7 board. The first player to have 4 tokens of their respective color consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal wins!

**Core.** The main part of this project's core will be implementing Connect 4 in C++, reading in moves and printing the board with the correct move inserted into the board. Your program will also be given a basic graphical user interface (GUI) to help with the visuals, written in OpenGL.

**Reach.** You will have several options for extending the core part of the project. There are two main paths: _AI_ and _Graphics_. For AI (artificial intelligence), you will be developing and creating the logic of a computer opponent in Connect 4. For Graphics, you will be using OpenGL and expanding on the already given GUI to create a unique look and feel for the game.
