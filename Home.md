## Project Overview
EECS 183. Winter 2016.

**Overview.** Create a working game of Connect 4! This two-player game involves the players alternately dropping a colored token (red and black) into a column of a 6x7 board. The first player to have 4 tokens of their respective color consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal wins!

**Core.** The main part of this project will be implementing Connect 4 in C++, reading in moves and printing the board via the terminal window. Your program will also have a basic GUI component to facilitate user interaction. 

**Reach.** You will have many options for extending the core part of the project. Potential extensions include: creating an AI for the game (so that you can play against the computer!), using OpenGL to create a unique look and feel for the game, implementing a new game, and more!
