The following is a list of pre-approved reach features. This list is non-exhaustive. If you wish to do a feature other than one listed on here, or a variation on one listed, you may do so, but you **must** contact us at 183connect4@umich.edu to get your feature _approved_. If you do not contact us to get a non-listed feature approved you will **likely not receive credit**.

Each feature has a difficulty listed in points, on a scale of 1 to 5. To receive full credit for the reach portion of the project, you must successfully complete features totaling at least 3 reach points.
